# dokku-supervisord

> Deprecated as of Dokku 0.3.14 (process management) and 0.7.0 (restart policies)

dokku-supervisord is a plugin for [dokku][dokku] that injects
[supervisord][super] to run applications. It will convert a normal Procfile to
supervisord.conf format when starting the application.

Normally, dokku only runs the `web` process within Procfile. The
dokku-supervisord plugin will run all process types (web, worker, etc.) and
will restart crashed applications.

# Not compatible with dokku 0.4+

As of dokku 0.4, plugins require a `plugin.toml` file. dokku-supervisord will not install correctly. Also, the functionality of multiple proceses and restarting is built into dokku now and should not require a plugin. See [issue #30](https://github.com/statianzo/dokku-supervisord/issues/30) for details. If you're still interested in using supervisord past dokku 0.4 check out [dokku-logging-supervisord](https://github.com/sehrope/dokku-logging-supervisord).

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/statianzo/dokku-supervisord.git /var/lib/dokku/plugins/dokku-supervisord
dokku plugins-install
```

All future deployments will use supervisord to start all processes.

## v0.4.0 breaking change

v0.4.0 renamed the `post-release` to `post-build-buildstep` to keep compatibility with upstream dokku. If you're using an older version of dokku, be sure to pin your version to v0.3.x.

## Docker 0.10 support

dokku-supervisord v0.3.0 changed the expected namespace from "app" to "dokku"
to support Docker 0.10. See details within the [dokku issue][docker10]. If
you're using a dokku version from before [this commit][docker10commit], stick
with v0.2.x of dokku-supervisord.
